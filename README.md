# Rainforest
Rainforest is a simplified clone of Amazon originally built as an introductory
Rails project for [Bitmaker's](https://www.bitmaker.co) full-stack web-development
program. This was my first project utilizing model associations and Rails in general.

Since then, Foundation has been added for styling, and AJAX has been
integrated into the views.

## Instructions

1. clone this repository
2. bundle install
3. run rails server
4. check out Rainforest on localhost:3000
